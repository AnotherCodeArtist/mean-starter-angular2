This is a simple MEAN starter project integrating Node/Express, MongoDB/Mongoose, Passport (using JWT) and Angular2.

It is basically a merge of the following two projects:
[angular2-webpack-starter](https://github.com/AngularClass/angular2-webpack-starter)
[Vulgar](https://github.com/datatypevoid/vulgar)

This was necessare since there's apparently no template project available the supports the latest version of Angular2 (currently 2.0.2) and the rest of the MEAN stack.

To integrate node and webpack [webpack-dev-middleware](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-middleware) and [webpack-hot-middleware](https://github.com/glenjamin/webpack-hot-middleware) have been used.
